TO DO LIST:

Add a menu that slides up when the player wins presenting the option to:
retry
change settings
or go to main menu

This mene can be used to as the pause menu too with slight modifications.



Add difficult:
easy - shows correct tiles you step on
medium - shows the last tile you stepped on
hard - the current one right now



Maybe add challenges?
Eg.
Beat a _x_ grid without restarting more than 10 times!
Beat a _x_ grid in under 1 minute!
Beat a _x_ grid while the player is invisible! (You not only have to keep track of what tiles you stepped on but also where the player is)
Beat a 3x3 map with no path (You have to spam forward to get to the end. Its a glitch. Maybe I will keep it?)
