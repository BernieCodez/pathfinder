    <h2>Pathfinder's Detailed Guide</h2>
    <p>Need help with anything? You've come to the right place. 
      From playing instructions, to strategies, to millions of helpful resources, 
    this guide has it all! Such a detailed guide must have a table of content. 
  Feel free to skip around below.</p>
    
      <h3>How To Play</h3>
      <p>There are two ways to learn the game. You can read the following rules
      and instructions or you could click on the Start Tutorial button below 
      and start a step by step tutorial guide that allows you to play as you
      learn.</p>

      <button id="tutorial" class="glow-button">
        Start Tutorial
      </button>

      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <P>
        The goal of the game is to reach the end (very top) by stepping
        on the right path blocks, hence the name Pathfinder. However the 
        right path isn't always obvious (life reference?). Actually its 
        invisible! In order to beat the game you must guess the correct
        path to step on. If you guess wrong you get sent back to the start 
        (called a "reset"). However if you guess right you stay and guess
        the next path. You may notice that some blocks glow white when stepped on
        or in the top/bottom of the map. Those are permenantly safe blocks
        that can be stepped on to your content. 
        Pathfinder is a test of the mind. You must memorize the path and the 
        sequence to move in. Good luck! (And uh have fun maybe?)
      </p>
      <h3>Settings</h3>
      <p>Pathfinder comes with a settings page where you can customize your game!
        It's accessible from the main menu. It allows you to choose between generated and custom 
        made maps (read more in the Custom vs Generated section). And settings for 
        them. You can also explore the challenges and complete them to earn...
        bragging rights?
      </p>
      <h4>Custom vs Generated</h4>
      <p>
        The first thing you see on the settings page is a dropdown menu with the options
        Custom or Generated. So what exactly is this? You can probably guess but I'll 
        tell you anyway. 
        <br>
        Playing a generated map means when playing the game it will
        use a computer generated map (different every time). You get the option to choose
        what size map you want with 5 being the recommend.
        <br>
        Selecting custom means you get to play a map created by someone online or your own map!
        How cool is that (I'm so hyped about this feature)? When you build a map you can submit
        it via this link: _______ (also found in the resources section) and it will get showcased
        in the community map gallary accessible by this link: _____ (also found in the resources
        section). When you select the custom option you will see a "Create your custom map
        by clicking HERE". Clicking it will bring you to the custom map builder. Alternatively you 
        can access the same thing through this link: ________. A detailed guide for creating custom
        maps and uploading them can be found in the Custom Map section from the table of contents.
      </p>
      <h4>Difficulty</h4>
      <p>
        Pathfinder may seem a bit daunting at first but don't worry! There are difficulties
        to help ease your way into the game and become a pro!
        As a beginner I recommend you start on easy to see how the game plays.
        Guessing which path is right and such. Then getting to a more difficult 
        mode like medium weher you are starting to memorize the sequence of the paths.
        Then finally hard mode, where you have to both memorize the path you test and 
        in which sequence. Of course there is also the impossible mode which only
        the best of the best can accomplish. Wait are you saying that you can beat it?
        Hah! Say that when you beat it! (Best of luck player!)
      </P>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        So you've seen the challenge button! Uh its still a work in progress. 
        Come back in 2 years?
      </P>
      

      <h3> Custom Map </h3>
      <p>
        Here we will go through a detailed guide of how to create a custom map.
        More features can be expected to be added to the custom map builder (in 2 
        years -_-)! You will see input boxes for row and column of the map. These
        can be modified to create the size grid you want. 
        <br>
        NOTE! PLEASE wait until AFTER the map finishes loading before inputing
        a new value. You may see flat grids. If you do then you may need to 
        refresh your page to resolve
        <br>
        Below the row/column inputs is a section to choose what you place.
        Currently you can choose between path and safe block. Read the Block 
        Types section to see what each type does. When you have a block type selected
        you can click any box in the map and it will light up indicating it has been placed.
        If you click again it should return to default state.

        <br>
        So now you're done with your map and want to give it a test! Great! 
        Just give that export button a lil tap! It will copy your map data onto
        your clipboard. Yep! Just like that!
      </p>

      <h4>Block Types</h4>
      <p>
        Curious about the block types I see! Currently there are 2 types.
        Hopefully more coming soon!

        <br>
        Path Block - Your typical path block. When played they turn invisible 
        forcing the player to guess the sequence you placed them in. There is a 
        counter input which allows you to change which sequence you want to place.
        NOTE! The first block should start with 0 NOT 1.

        <br>
        Safe Block - A completely safe block. It doesn't turn invisible and is 
        fully visible to the player.
